== Introduction

This is a sample repository to demonstrate Git and handling of merge conflicts.

== Creating and handling merge conflicts

* We're going to create merge conflicts in this repository during the workshop.
This is intended, and is part of why there are numerous typos.

To create some conflicts:

. Make some form of change to this file and commit your changes.
Once everyone has made some kind of change and committed it, we'll update this file remotely.

. Once the file has been updated, try pulling the new changes:
+
----
$ git pull
----

. You should encounter merge conflicts because I'll  change almost every line of this file in some way or another.

. This will give us the opportunity to work through the merge conflicts during the workshop and hopefully end up with a much nicer repository.

A lot of the information that we'll be going over today is also documented in my Avoiding Merge Conflicts (link:https://github.com/robin-owen/avoiding-merge-conflicts[robin-owen/avoiding-merge-conflicts]) repository on GitHub.
